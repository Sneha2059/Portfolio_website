                <div class="research-statement">
                    <p>My journey as a researcher and engineer has been driven by a deep curiosity for understanding and advancing continuum mechanics and multiscale modeling, while leveraging modern computational tools to address engineering challenges. Starting in robotics, I worked with control systems and hardware designs that often lacked scalability, which motivated me to explore data-driven approaches. Over time, I realized the potential of combining traditional engineering methods with AI/ML as auxiliary tools to accelerate and enhance modeling, simulation, and design processes.</p>
<p>Currently, as a Research Intern at Autolab Tech (soon transitioning to a full-time role), I am investigating graph neural networks (GNNs) for classifying and retrieving 3D-CAD models directly from STEP files. STEP files preserve precise geometric and topological information, making them valuable for engineering applications. My work aims to develop efficient computational methods that interpret such complex structures, contributing to smarter CAD retrieval systems and generative design.</p>
                    <p>My research interest lies at the intersection of multiscale modeling, continuum mechanics, and artificial intelligence. I aim to develop hybrid frameworks that integrate physics-based models with AI to bridge scales from microstructural phenomena to macroscopic material behavior. Traditional continuum and multiscale methods, though powerful, often face limitations in computational cost and generalization; AI offers a transformative tool to accelerate simulations, learn complex constitutive laws, and embed physical constraints through approaches like physics-informed neural networks and surrogate models. By combining these paradigms, my goal is to create robust, interpretable, and computationally efficient models that enhance predictive capabilities in engineering applications such as material design, structural analysis, and biomechanics, ultimately contributing to more reliable and scalable solutions for real-world challenges.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, my core research interest lies at the intersection of multiscale modeling and continuum mechanics, with AI/ML serving as enabling tools. I aim to develop hybrid frameworks that integrate physics-based models with data-driven methods to bridge scales from microstructural phenomena to macroscopic material behavior. Traditional continuum and multiscale methods, while powerful, often face limitations in computational cost and generalization; AI, particularly physics-informed approaches, offers a way to reduce these barriers by accelerating simulations and embedding physical constraints. My goal is to create robust, interpretable, and computationally efficient models that enhance predictive capabilities in engineering applications such as material design, structural analysis,.</p>
<p>To advance this research, I aim to collaborate with leading experts in academic environments where interdisciplinary approaches are valued, particularly those that combine strong foundations in mechanics with modern computational strategies.</p>
                    <p>Despite hailing from a country with limited developmental resources, I have consistently dared 
to dream ambitiously. My commitment to excellence is evident in the diligent efforts I have 
invested thus far, and I remain steadfast in my resolve to persevere and excel, given the 
appropriate opportunity.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal is to push the boundaries of data-driven engineering,material behaviour, creating AI systems that 
not only enhance design automation but also foster innovation in manufacturing, 
socio-technical systems, robotics, and beyond.</p>

                <p style="color: #6c757d; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Here I share my insights and understanding of various research papers I've studied.</p>
                <p style="color: #6c757d; margin-bottom: 2rem;">These blogs will be mix of my personal reflections and summaries of the papers, aiming to make complex topics more accessible.</p>
                <p style="color: #6c757d; margin-bottom: 2rem;">I will very soon be updating and adding blogs!</p>
