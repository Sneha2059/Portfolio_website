                <div class="research-statement">
                    <p>My journey as a researcher and engineer has been driven by a deep curiosity for bridging the gap 
between traditional engineering and cutting-edge AI/ML. Starting in robotics, I worked with 
control systems and hardware designs that often lacked scalability, pushing me toward 
data-driven approaches to solve complex engineering challenges. This exploration led me to 
AI/ML, where I discovered the immense potential of machine learning in transforming 
engineering design, particularly in data-driven design, scientific machine learning (Sci-ML), 
and geometric deep learning.</p>
<p>Currently, as a Research Intern at Autolab Tech (soon transitioning to a full-time role), I am 
investigating graph neural networks (GNNs) for classifying and retrieving 3D-CAD models 
directly from STEP files. Unlike mesh-based representations, STEP files preserve precise 
geometric and topological information, making them ideal for engineering applications. My 
work focuses on developing robust AI models that can interpret these complex structures without 
information loss, paving the way for smarter CAD retrieval systems and generative design tools. 
Looking ahead, I aspire to deepen my research in data-driven design and AI-augmented 
engineering, particularly Scientific Machine Learning (Sci-ML) for Engineering which helps in   
leveraging physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and hybrid models to enhance simulation, 
optimization, and inverse design, Geometric Deep Learning for  Expanding the use of GNNs, 
transformers, and diffusion models for structured 3D engineering data, improving generative 
design and automated manufacturing, and AI/ML at the Engineering Intersection which works 
on developing interpretable, real-world applicable AI systems that integrate seamlessly with 
industrial workflows.</p>
<p>To advance this research, I aim to collaborate with leading experts in the field, where interdisciplinary AI/ML research is thriving. I am eager to 
contribute to and learn from academic environments that emphasize practical, impactful research 
at the intersection of AI and engineering.</p>
<p>Despite hailing from a country with limited developmental resources, I have consistently dared 
to dream ambitiously. My commitment to excellence is evident in the diligent efforts I have 
invested thus far, and I remain steadfast in my resolve to persevere and excel, given the 
appropriate opportunity.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal is to push the boundaries of data-driven engineering, creating AI systems that 
not only enhance design automation but also foster innovation in manufacturing, 
socio-technical systems, robotics, and beyond.</p>

                <p style="color: #6c757d; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Here I share my insights and understanding of various research papers I've studied.</p>
                <p style="color: #6c757d; margin-bottom: 2rem;">These blogs will be mix of my personal reflections and summaries of the papers, aiming to make complex topics more accessible.</p>
                <p style="color: #6c757d; margin-bottom: 2rem;">I will very soon be updating and adding blogs!</p>
