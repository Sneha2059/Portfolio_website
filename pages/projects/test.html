    <h2>How Point-GNN Transforms Raw Point Clouds into Graphs</h2>
    
    <p>At the heart of Point-GNN is its clever way of converting messy 3D point cloud data into an organized graph structure that neural networks can understand. Here's how it works:</p>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>1. Defining the Point Cloud Structure</h3>
        <p>Each point in the cloud has two main components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="term">3D coordinates</span> (x,y,z position)</li>
            <li><span class="term">State value</span> (could be laser intensity or other features about the point's surroundings)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="diagram-placeholder">
        [Visualization: Raw point cloud with some points highlighted to show coordinates and properties]
    </div>
    
    <h3>2. Building the Graph</h3>
    <p>Point-GNN connects the dots (literally!) by:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Treating each point as a <span class="term">vertex</span> in a graph</li>
        <li>Creating <span class="term">edges</span> between points that are close to each other (within a set radius)</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Technical note:</strong> This "fixed radius near-neighbors" problem is solved efficiently using spatial partitioning techniques, keeping the computation manageable even for large point clouds.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>3. Handling Real-World Data Challenges</h3>
    <p>Since real LiDAR scans often contain <span class="term">tens of thousands of points</span>, Point-GNN uses smart optimizations:</p>
    
    <div class="diagram-placeholder">
        [Before/After diagram showing voxel downsampling]
    </div>
    
    <ul>
        <li><span class="term">Voxel downsampling:</span> Gently reduces point density while preserving important structure</li>
        <li><span class="term">Feature preservation:</span> Even after downsampling, information from nearby raw points is encoded into each vertex using a small neural network</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>This graph construction approach gives Point-GNN three key advantages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Works with the natural structure of point clouds instead of forcing them into artificial grids</li>
            <li><strong>Information preservation:</strong> Maintains details from the original scan through smart feature encoding</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Handles large real-world datasets without excessive computation</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <p>The resulting graph becomes the perfect input for the graph neural network to start detecting objects - which we'll cover in the next section!</p>
